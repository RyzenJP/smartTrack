# ✅ Create New Project - Quick Steps

## ✅ I've Removed the Old Project ID

The old project ID has been removed from `app.json`. Now you can create a new project with your new account.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Create New Project

```bash
eas init
```

When asked:
- **"Would you like to create a new project?"** → **Yes** ✅
- **"What would you like to name your project?"** → `smart-track-mobile` (or press Enter for default)

This will:
- Create a NEW project with your NEW account
- Automatically add the new project ID to `app.json`
- Give you fresh build time! 🎉

### Step 2: Build Your App

```bash
eas build --platform android
```

This should work now! ✅

## ✅ What I Did

1. ✅ Removed old project ID: `8689863b-f457-49c6-8b01-f6c4c6508bb5`

Now when you run `eas init`, it will create a brand new project with your new account!
